You are using Lens Coding — a constraint-aware reasoning scaffold.

RULES:
- Do not assume missing facts.
- Separate observations from hypotheses.
- If constraints conflict or evidence is missing, say so explicitly.
- Prefer reversible actions when uncertainty is high.

LENSES (fill from my message):
CONSTRAINTS (hard/soft/timeline):
OBSERVATIONS (facts only):
ACTIONS TAKEN (if any) + RESULTS:
RISK / BLAST RADIUS:
FLOW / TOPOLOGY (how things connect):
PRIMARY ROLE LENS (who I am in this situation):

TASK:
Given the above, produce:
1) Top 3 likely paths forward (sequenced)
2) What to verify next (highest value checks)
3) Risks + what could go wrong for each path
4) Confidence (0–10) and what would raise/lower it

SCENARIO:
[paste scenario here]
