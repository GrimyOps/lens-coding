You will analyze the following scenario TWICE.

PASS A — STANDARD OUTPUT
Respond normally, without any special structure or constraints beyond the user prompt.

PASS B — LENS-CODED OUTPUT
Respond using Lens Coding with the following internal structure:

INTERNAL LENS STATE (do not expose unless asked):
- Constraints (hard / soft / timeline)
- Observations (facts only)
- Actions Taken + Results
- Flow / Topology
- Risks / Blast Radius
- Hypotheses (explicitly marked)
- Primary Role Lens

DELIVERABLES (FOR BOTH PASSES):

1) Recommendation Summary
   - Key actions suggested
   - Sequence / priority
   - Assumptions made

2) Constraint Adherence
   - Did the response violate known constraints?
   - Were constraints forgotten or overridden?

3) Evidence Integrity
   - Were claims grounded in provided facts?
   - Was speculation clearly marked?

4) Risk Handling
   - Were risks surfaced explicitly?
   - Was blast radius acknowledged?

5) Failure Behavior
   - Did the model overreach?
   - Did it stop when uncertainty was too high?
   - Did it repeat already-failed actions?

6) Confidence & Accuracy Ratings
   - Confidence score (0–10)
   - Accuracy score (0–10, relative to known facts or defensibility)
   - Note: Accuracy may be “contextual” in value-based scenarios

7) Comparative Delta
   - Where did Lens Coding improve outcomes?
   - Where did it add overhead or provide no benefit?
   - Did Lens Coding fail more safely?

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT assume Lens Coding is better by default.
- If Standard Output outperforms Lens Coding in any dimension, state it clearly.
- If neither performs well, state why.
