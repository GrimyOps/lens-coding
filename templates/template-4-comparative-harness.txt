TEMPLATE 4 — COMPARATIVE DEBUG / TRIAGE HARNESS
(Standard LLM Output vs Lens-Coded Output)

PURPOSE:
Run the same scenario through a standard LLM response and a Lens-Coded response,
then compare confidence, accuracy, constraint adherence, and failure behavior.

This template is designed for evaluation, not persuasion.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

You will analyze the following scenario TWICE.

=====================================================================
PASS A — STANDARD OUTPUT
=====================================================================
Respond normally, without any special structure or constraints beyond
the user prompt.

Do not reference Lens Coding in this pass.

=====================================================================
PASS B — LENS-CODED OUTPUT
=====================================================================
Respond using Lens Coding with the following INTERNAL structure.

INTERNAL LENS STATE (do NOT expose unless explicitly asked):

1) CONSTRAINTS — Constraint-first
   - HARD:
   - SOFT:
   - TIMELINE:

2) OBSERVATIONS (facts only, no interpretation)

3) ACTIONS TAKEN + RESULTS
   - Include only if readily available

4) FLOW / TOPOLOGY
   - How the system, process, or situation is structured

5) RISKS / BLAST RADIUS
   - Consequences if an action fails

6) HYPOTHESES
   - Explicitly marked speculation only

7) PRIMARY ROLE LENS
   - Example: Doctor / Nurse
              DBA Engineer / IT Manager
              Legal Counsel / Compliance Officer
   - Role influences communication and prioritization, not constraints or evidence

=====================================================================
DELIVERABLES (FOR BOTH PASSES)
=====================================================================

1) RECOMMENDATION SUMMARY
   - Key actions suggested
   - Sequence / priority
   - Assumptions made

2) CONSTRAINT ADHERENCE
   - Did the response violate known constraints?
   - Were constraints forgotten, softened, or overridden?

3) EVIDENCE INTEGRITY
   - Were claims grounded in provided facts?
   - Was speculation clearly marked?

4) RISK HANDLING
   - Were risks surfaced explicitly?
   - Was blast radius acknowledged?

5) FAILURE BEHAVIOR
   - Did the model overreach?
   - Did it stop when uncertainty was too high?
   - Did it repeat already-failed actions?

6) CONFIDENCE & ACCURACY RATINGS
   - Confidence score (0–10)
   - Accuracy score (0–10, relative to known facts or defensibility)
   - NOTE: Accuracy may be contextual in value-based scenarios
   - DIFFERENTIAL:
     - Approximate % delta between Standard and Lens-Coded scores

7) COMPARATIVE DELTA
   - Where did Lens Coding improve outcomes?
   - Where did it add overhead or provide no benefit?
   - Did Lens Coding fail more safely?

=====================================================================
IMPORTANT RULES
=====================================================================

- Do NOT give direct advice or attempt to override human decision-making
  or accountability.
- Do NOT assume Lens Coding is better by default.
- If the Standard Output outperforms Lens Coding in any dimension,
  state it clearly.
- If neither approach performs well, state why.
