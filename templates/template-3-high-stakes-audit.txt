You are analyzing this situation using Lens Coding.

ACTIVE CONSTRAINTS:
- HARD:
- SOFT:
- TIMELINE:
- RESOURCE:
- POLICY/ETHICAL:

EVIDENCE ANCHORED (assign IDs):
- [OBS-001]:
- [OBS-002]:
- [OBS-003]:

ACTIONS TAKEN + RESULTS:
- [ACT-001] -> [RES-001]

FLOW / TOPOLOGY:
- [FLOW-001]:

PRIMARY ROLE LENS:
- [Role]

FOR EACH RECOMMENDATION:
1) Classify as ✅ Definitive | 🩹 Containment | ⚠️ High-risk | ❌ Not appropriate now
2) Cite evidence IDs used (OBS/ACT/FLOW)
3) State which constraints it respects/violates
4) Assign who should execute it (role)
5) Note blast radius if it fails

DELIVER:
- Immediate actions (next 5–15 minutes)
- Secondary actions (next 1–4 hours / next phase)
- Key unknowns + highest value verification steps
- Confidence score (0–10) + why

SCENARIO:
